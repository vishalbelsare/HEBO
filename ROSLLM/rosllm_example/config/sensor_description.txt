This sensor provides the current simulated pose of a turtle in the turtlesim environment.
It outputs five floating-point values:

(1) x – the turtle’s horizontal position in the simulator’s world coordinates.
(2) y – the turtle’s vertical position in the simulator’s world coordinates.
(3) theta – the turtle’s orientation in radians, measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.
(4) linear_velocity – the turtle’s forward speed in units per second.
(5) angular_velocity – the turtle’s rotational speed in radians per second.

The values are continuously updated to reflect the turtle’s movement and heading in the simulation.
